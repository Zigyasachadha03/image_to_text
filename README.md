# Image-to-text Recognition

This project utilizes OCR (Optical Character Recognition) technology to extract text from images. It employs the pytesseract OCR engine for text extraction. The project is implemented using Node.js and utilizes the EJS file to properly link with Node.js.

## Overview

The Image-to-text Recognition project aims to convert textual information from images into machine-readable text. By leveraging OCR technology, the project provides a solution for extracting text from various image formats.

## Features

- Extracts text from images using OCR
- Supports multiple image formats
- Utilizes pytesseract OCR engine for accurate text extraction
- Implements the project using Node.js
- Uses EJS files for proper linking with Node.js

## Installation

To set up the Image-to-text Recognition project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
` $ git clone https://github.com/your-username/Image-to-text-recognition.git `

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
$ cd Image-to-text-recognition
$ npm install
```

3. Configure the project:
- Update any required settings or configurations in the project.
- Make sure pytesseract OCR engine is properly installed and configured.

4. Start the server:
` $ node index.js `

5. Access the application:
Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:5000` to access the Image-to-text Recognition application.

## Usage

1. Upload an image containing text to the application.
2. The application will use OCR to extract the text from the image.
3. The extracted text will be displayed on the webpage or in the output file, depending on your project configuration.
